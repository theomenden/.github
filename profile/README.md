# Welcome to The Omen Den!

## We primarly focus on using `C#` and the `.NET` Technology Stack
  - Our primary operations include creating class libraries, and Blazor applications (both server and webassembly) 

## We're all about creating easy to understand, accessible software
  - We are currently pushing out Nuget packages, and remain committed to their maintainence.
  - Each repository will do it's best to showcase the particular focus for a package
  - We will also add tests intermittently, but will create applications using the particular package for better demonstration

## We want to explore different design patterns, libraries, and architectures when it comes to our development practices
  - We try to explore best fits, and adhere to Clean software standards, and SOLID principles. 
  - We aren't dogmatic in our approach to development however, and you'll see that reflected in our work
  - Most of our software will feature heavy use of XML/CSharp Docs to allow for ease of use with intellisense and other suggestive-hints

## We also offer software consulting services for various .NET applications, as well as a clothing brand
